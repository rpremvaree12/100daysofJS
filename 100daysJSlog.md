# 100 Days Of JS Code - Log

### Day 1: February 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: set up environment, installed node, created template files for the projects, created a simple counter app using event delegation.

**Thoughts:** I learned about the difference between querySelector vs. getELementById and getElementbyClass. Query selector returns the first matching item whereas getElementBy returns a collection of matching items. I also played around a lot with setting up twitter, publishing projects with GH pages. Zino suggested making a screencast. I'll think about how I want to incorporate that into my workflow for my next projects.

### Day 2: February 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: worked on the Day 3 random color generator and finished it. Started the Day 4 Modal Project.

**Thoughts:** Nothing terribly new. It was nice to feel more comfortable with selecting and manipulating DOM elements as well as syntax.

### Day 3: February 26, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed the modal popup generator for Day 4 projects. Started  markup for the Day 5 project - palindrome checker.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to create a popup using two simple JS functions and display block, display none.
